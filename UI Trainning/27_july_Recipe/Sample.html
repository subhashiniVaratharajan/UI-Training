    <h1>Ripe red juicy tomatoes</h1>
    <p>
        Tomatoes are a key ingredient here which form the base of the makhani sauce or gravy. Makhani sauce is prepared from scratch with fresh ingredients like tomatoes (specifically pureed tomatoes), cashews and butter. Onions can be added if you want. Though traditionally onions are never added in a makhani gravy. So do use tomatoes that are ripe and have a slight sweetness in them. Avoid adding tomatoes that are sour or too tart or unripe.
    </p>
    <h1>Cashews</h1>
    <p>Yet another important ingredient is cashews which imparts a lovely creaminess and sheen in the dish. The sweetness of the cashews also balances the tanginess of the tomatoes. Generally in butter chicken or butter paneer, cream is added. To give a creamy consistency and a sweet tinge, I add both cashew paste and cream.</p>
<h1>Cream</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, apart from cashews I also add a bit of cream which thickens the gravy slightly and makes it rich. Though adding cream can be skipped for a less rich version.</p>
<h1>Butter</h1>
<p>The amount of butter that is added is not huge but just right in this paneer butter masala recipe. Butter makes the curry a bit rich and buttery. Though you can go overboard by adding some more butter.</p>

<h1>Panner</h1>
<p>A quality of paneer can make or break your dish. What you want are succulent soft paneer cubes gently coated with a smooth, buttery tomato sauce. So make sure to use either homemade paneer or good quality store brought paneer. Follow the instructions on the package before using paneer.</p>
<h1>Spices and herbs</h1>
<p>The list of spices is not much. For that brilliant orange color, you need to add kashmiri red chilli powder. You can sub it with cayenne pepper or paprika. You will also need garam masala powder. Kasuri methi which are dried fenugreek leaves also add a good flavor. Just skip them if you do not have. For garnish cilantro (coriander leaves) are added.</p>

<h1>Making of Panner Butter Masala</h1>

<h1>Preparation</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.</li>
<li>When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.</li>
<li>Bouquet Garni Start with wrapping the spices in a muslin or cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni. This helps add all the flavour without having to fish out the spices one by one later</li>
<li>Cook the kashmiri chillies, onion, tomato, cashew, poppy seeds and spices together till the tomatoes are soft and pulpy. This is the base of the gravy
<li>Remove the bouquet garni (whole spices) and the blend the onion tomato paste to really smooth. You can add some water if required</li>
<li>Simmer the gravy along with powdered spices and salt in butter for 10-15 minutes till you can see a little oil floating to the top</li>
<li>Smoke the gravy with my dungar method <a href="https://youtu.be/pjJgCXx_FRk" target="blank">(video)</a>. This takes the gravy to the next level!</li>
<li>Add kasuri methi, paneer and cream, cook for a minute or two and you are done!</li>
</ul>
